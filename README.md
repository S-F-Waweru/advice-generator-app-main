# Advice Generator App

## Overview

Welcome to the **Advice Generator App**! This simple yet fun app provides a daily dose of random advice to keep you inspired and motivated. With just a click of a button, you'll receive a fresh piece of advice, sourced from a reliable API. It’s a great way to get quick wisdom whenever you need it.

### Features:
- **Daily Advice**: Click the button to receive a new, random piece of advice.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, minimalist design that’s easy to use on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Interactive**: Tap the button to instantly get a new piece of advice, with a smooth, responsive experience.

## How It Works

1. The app fetches advice from the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) using a simple fetch request.
2. Once you click the button, a new piece of advice is displayed on the screen. The advice is dynamically pulled from the API and displayed in a clean, easy-to-read format.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** for structuring the content.
- **CSS (Tailwind)** for responsive styling.
- **JavaScript** for functionality and fetching advice from the API.
- **Advice Slip API**: A free API that provides random pieces of advice to help inspire and guide users.
